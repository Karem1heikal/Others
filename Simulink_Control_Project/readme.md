# Simulink Control Project

This repository showcases two simulation-based projects developed using MATLAB/Simulink. These projects demonstrate the modeling, analysis, and visualization of dynamic systems in both mechanical and electrical domains.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Mechanical_Simulation.slx` – Simulink model for mechanical system simulation.
- `Electrical_Circuit_Simulation.slx` – Simulink model for RLC/RL/LC circuit simulations.
- `Scope_Results/` – Captured outputs and scope visuals.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.

## 🎯 Project Descriptions

### 1. Mechanical System Simulation

- **Objective**: Model and simulate a mass-spring-damper system.
- **Focus**: Analyze the effects of external force, damping ratio, and system parameters on dynamic behavior.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Time-domain response visualization
  - Damping effect analysis
  - System stability insights

### 2. Electrical Circuit Simulation

- **Objective**: Design and simulate RLC, RL, and LC circuits.
- **Focus**: Study time and frequency responses under various configurations.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Step and sinusoidal input response
  - Resonance behavior
  - Parameter sensitivity analysis

## 🛠️ Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Simulink toolbox
- Control System Toolbox (recommended)
